# waww

### Getting started

Install **node.js**. Then **gulp** and **bower** if you haven't yet.

    $ npm -g install gulp bower

After that, install angular-kickstart downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/vesparny/angular-kickstart/releases) (or clone the master branch if you want to run the development version). Unzip the project and cd into it, then install bower and npm dependencies, and run the application in development mode.

    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ bower install bootstrap --save -dev
    $ bower install angular-material --save -dev
    $ gulp serve
